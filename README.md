# Genetic Algorithm Neural Network
## By Adam Titus

#### _A Unity scene that demonstrates a genetic algorithm of neural networks learning to solve a simple maze._

## Technologies Used
* Built off of [Adrians](https://github.com/ajagnic) [NeuralNetDemo](https://github.com/ajagnic/NeuralNetDemo)
* Unity
* Visual Studio

## Technologies Needed
* Windows Unity

## Installation Instructions
* Clone this project down to your desktop
* Open that folder in Unity
* Open the Demo scene in Unity
* Click the play button at the top of the screen
* Let run for as long as you want. (Speed and amount of agents that hit the target will plateau around 145, epoch 20ish)

## Known Bugs
* Colors are correct, although they look misleading
* Currently working on a timed area in order to discourage agents that hang in the back and avoid touching walls
